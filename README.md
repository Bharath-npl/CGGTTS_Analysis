Time & Frequency Capacity building

CGGTTS_Analyser is a tool to analyse the CGGTTS data. Developed by Time and Frequency Capacity building Project of BIPM 2023. 
This is a browser based application developed in Streamlit platform on Python. The user can simply upload the two receiver data files of CGGTTS and perform the common view and All-in-view analysis. 
There are various filters provided for the analysis like selection of GNSS code measurement (L1C, L3P, L5C etc., ), selection of range of data, outlier filter, satellite selection, and elevation mask. 
The user can also download the data correspding to each plot in the application and also the plots. 

This will help the timining community to process the data using a common application and exchange the dicsussions. 

Currently in version V1.0 the intercompatability of the CGGTTS versions (V1, V2 and V2E )is an issue. 
For Example if the receiver 1 CGGTTS data set is of V2 then the receiver 2 CGGTTS data set should also be V2 only. 
Only in case of GPS it works for all versions of CGGTTS.
